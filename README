A library for PAM modules to aid in limiting execution to the first
open_session and the last close_session of a user, aka on their first login
and last logout.

Example:
	#include <pam-once.h>

	pam_sm_open_session(pam_handle_t *pamh, ...) {
		int ret;
		ret = pam_once_open_session(pamh, NULL);
		if (ret == PAM_SUCCESS) {
			/* run module */
			return PAM_SUCCESS;
		} else if (ret == PAM_IGNORE) {
			/* don't run module */
			return PAM_IGNORE;
		}
		/* error */
		return ret;
	}
